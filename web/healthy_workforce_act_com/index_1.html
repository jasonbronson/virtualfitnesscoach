<h1>Healthy Workforce Act of 2009</h1>
<h3><font color="blue">*Recent studies by Congress prove healthier workers miss less work, are more productive, and have lower health care costs.*
</font></h3></center>
<b>WHAT IS IT?</b><br><br>
Sen. Tom Harkins (D-Iowa), notable for his 2007 lobbying against America’s unsustainable “sick-care system,” has reintroduced the Healthy Workforce Act (sponsored by Representative Earl Blumenauer). Harkins asks that Congress redirect its healthcare focus “toward wellness, disease prevention, exercise, good nutrition, and staying out of the hospital in the first place.” The Healthy Workforce Act offers tax credits of up to 50% for businesses who implement wellness initiatives to employees.
<br><br><b>COMPONENTS OF A QUALIFIED WELLNESS PROGRAM:</b><br><br>
<ul>1)     Health Awareness – health education and health screenings
2)     Employee Engagement – worksite wellness programs, assessments, evaluations and tracking of employee participation
3)     Behavioral Change – seminars, online programs or self-help materials
4)     Supportive Environment – incentives for participation in health screenings or behavioral health programs
</ul>
<b>LIMITATIONS:</b>
<ul><li>Businesses with 200 employees or less – tax credits cannot  exceed $200 per employee
<li>Businesses with 200 employees or more – tax credits cannot exceed $100 per employee
<li>Credit period will last up to 10 taxable years after wellness program is implemented 
</ul>(Ends: December 31, 2017)
