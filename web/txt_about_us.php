                                    On and off for the last 30 years I’ve been a personal trainer in gyms and at people’s homes.
                                    I realized that for every person who can afford to hire me as their personal trainer, there are
                                    hundreds of others who need my coaching skills when it comes to exercise and nutrition, but
                                    don’t quite have the budget. So I decided to join forces with a few computer geniuses and
                                    virtualized myself... So now you can get all of the benefits of working with a personal trainer
                                    without the traditional costs.

                                    Personally speaking, I refuse to go to a doctor who looks unhealthy. That’s just me. So
                                    when it comes to you hiring a personal trainer I think it’s important that you have confidence
                                    that you’re getting someone who doesn’t just talk the talk. Trust me when I say I’ve walked
                                    the walk. Actually, make that ran the run.*

                                    It means I’ve been there and done that. From exercising 40 hours a week to living as if
                                    every day was my birthday! And all points in between. So you can rest assured that I’ll be
                                    able to empathize with you regarding your obstacles or hurdles when it comes to leading
                                    the healthy and fit life you want for yourself, because I’ve been there. More importantly, I’ve
                                    been at the side of thousands of other individuals who have wanted to look or feel different
                                    than they currently do, but who have hit a plateau or got stuck in a series of bad habits. With
                                    my coaching I’ve created a new level of inspiration and motivation for them,
                                    which I can do for you too.
