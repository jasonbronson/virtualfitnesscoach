<strong>The following section covers use of specific user information by Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc.:</strong><br /><br />

1. Use of Demographic Information. The application registration form requires you to submit Demographic Information. Demographic Information is collected by Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc.  and either held by Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc. or transferred to the Provider. The Provider's use of the information is regulated by the user agreement or privacy policy of the Provider, and we are not responsible for the use of data by the Provider. We use Demographic Information primarily to customize our application for you, showing the content and information that is most pertinent to you. We use contact information from the Demographic Information to send you periodic e-mail newsletters which may contain offers of services and personalized motivational feedback regarding your fitness progress. WE DO NOT SELL YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES. If you wish to remove your contact information from the Application, you may do so by contacting Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc. at support@virtualfitnesscoach.com. <br /><br />

2. Anonymous Use of Demographic Information. Demographic Information is shared with affiliates, partners and advertisers on an aggregate, or collective, basis WITHOUT SHARING YOUR USER NAME OR CONTACT INFORMATION.<br /><br />

3. Use of Fitness Profile and Fitness Training Data. Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc. stores and maintains all Fitness Profile and Fitness Training Data collected by the Application. Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc. reserves the right to use the data collected to aid in research and development of the Application. We reserve the right to the use of the data in an anonymous format in any way we deem responsible and correct (whether it be the sale, publishing, or any other use). Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc. also reserves the right to do as we see fit with findings based on the data collected. If you cancel your registration to the Application, your Fitness Profile and Fitness Training Data are maintained in a strictly anonymous fashion. We reserve the right to the Fitness Profile and Fitness Training Data and to the continued use of that data. Fitness Profile and Fitness Training Data are the property of Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc.<br /><br />

4. Online Surveys. From time-to-time, you may find online surveys within the Application. Our online surveys may ask users or visitors for demographic information (like zip code or age). We may use data from our surveys to send information about our company and (with your permission) promotional material from some of our affiliates, partners, sponsors and advertisers.<br /><br />

5. Use of IP Addresses. An IP (Internet Protocol) address is your computer's Internet address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Application.

We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to customize the content and/or layout of the Application for you.<br /><br />

7. Message Boards and Other Public Forums.

10. Use of Navigation Paths. We track everything a user does within the Application. The type of information we collect includes (but is not limited to) where a user goes within the Application, how long a user is using the Application, and what links a user chooses. We do this by recording Navigation Paths. For example, we may track the number of people who view each page to learn which features are the most popular. By collecting data in this way, we can generate anonymous reports based on a user's Navigation Path that can tell a Provider or sponsor what users are doing within the Application and then can be used by our sponsors and Providers for marketing purposes. The data collected will also be incorporated into a user profile that helps Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc. personalize and enhance your 
online experience.<br /><br />

11. Joint Registration. In some cases, registration for the Application is carried out through a joint registration process with the Provider. In this case, you should understand that your membership with the Provider is regulated entirely by the user agreement of the Provider. In a joint registration process, Demographic Information and/or Subscription Information is collected by Virtual Fitness Coach, Inc. and transferred subsequently to the Provider. In all cases, terminating membership with the Provider will result in the loss of your access to the Application.
