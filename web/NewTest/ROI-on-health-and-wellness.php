                    Obesity and being overweight is a severe problem facing a vast majority of adults, families and companies throughout the
                    country. Improving the health, wellness and weight of employees and their families can significantly cut company costs on
                    insurance and health, as well as lost work days due to sickness and/or injury for employees. Moreover, employee well being
                    and quality of life can greatly be improved through an effective wellness program both short term and long term, promoting
                    a healthier lifestyle for employees and their families.</p>
