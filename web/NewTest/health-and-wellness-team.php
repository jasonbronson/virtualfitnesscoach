				     (Former President and COO of Sears Roebuck and Co.)</p>
                  <p align="justify">                      Jim Clifford has acted as an advisor to the company since mid-2008. Jim retired in 2002 from Sears Roebuck
                      and Company where he held the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of the mall based stores
                      ($25 billion in revenue). Prior to this position, Jim was President and Chief Operating Officer and member
                      of the Board of Directors of Sears Canada, a public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Jim
                      has held senior management positions with a variety of retailing and manufacturing companies. He has
                      served as Chief Financial Officer of four public companies and has served on the Board of Directors of three
                      companies. Since retiring, he has consulted with several companies and acted as Senior Advisor to Bearingpoint
                      Consulting formally KPMG Consulting.</p>
                  <p align="justify">                      Beginning nearly a year ago, Jim engaged Mel O&rsquo;Keefe as a personal trainer and has seen excellent gains in
                      his strength, fitness and overall health and wellness.</p>
                  <p align="justify">                      Jim states, &ldquo;Mel&rsquo;s training methods are effective - which is great for those fortunate individuals who can
                      afford to hire him one-on-one. I became involved with Virtual Fitness Coach because I believe that the
                      method and approach Mel developed is readily transferable to a virtual and extremely affordable medium.&rdquo;</p>
                  <p align="justify">                      <span class="px-greentext"><strong>Mel O&rsquo;Keefe, </strong></span><span class="px-blacktext">Founder and C.E.O. (Chief Exercise Officer)</span><br />
                      Mel O&rsquo;Keefe channeled his early executive business successes as vice president of several mid-size companies
                      to pursue his passion in health and fitness, which began 30 years ago. Mel had been an aspiring body
                      builder and personal trainer in London, England, and later obtained his Certified Personal Trainer (CPT)
                      accreditation from the National Academy of Sports Management (NASM).</p>
                  <p align="justify">                      In 2002, Mel took a year-long sabbatical to run a road race a week for 52 weeks, while travelling around
                      America to raise awareness and funds to fight cancer. During this period, he became a marathon coach
                      for Team in Training (TNT), a fundraising division of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, where he was
                      awarded the Team in Training Man of the Year Award for his motivational speaking and many visitations of
                      support with children suffering from cancer. His passion for running and fundraising ultimately ulminated
                      in a &ldquo;marathon-a-day for 18 days&rdquo; event for cancer research by running from San Diego to Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
                  <p align="justify">                      Today, Mel continues to train clients one-on-one driven by the goal of helping people change their lives<br />
                      through health, fitness and improved quality of life.</p>
