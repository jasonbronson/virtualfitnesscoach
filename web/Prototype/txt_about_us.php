                            <div style="">
                            On and off for the last 30 years I’ve been a personal trainer in gyms and at people’s homes.
                            I realized that for every person who can afford to hire me as their personal trainer, there are
                            hundreds of others who need my coaching skills when it comes to exercise and nutrition but
                            don’t quite have the budget. So I decided to join forces with a few computer geniuses and
                            virtualized myself... so now you can get all of the benefits of working with a personal trainer
                            without the traditional costs.

                            <div style="">
                            Personally speaking, I refuse to go to a doctor who looks unhealthy. That’s just me. So
                            when it comes to you hiring a personal trainer I think it’s important that you have confidence
                            that you’re getting someone who doesn’t just talk the talk. Trust me when I say I’ve walked
                            the walk. Actually, make that ran the run.*

                             <div style="">
                             It means I’ve been there and done that. From exercising 40 hours a week to living as if
                            every day was my birthday! And all points in between. So you can rest assured that I’ll be
                            able to empathize with you regarding your obstacles or hurdles when it comes to leading
                            the healthy and fit life you want for yourself, because I’ve been there. More importantly, I’ve
                            been at the side of thousands of other individuals who have wanted to look or feel different
                            than they currently do but who have hit a plateau or got stuck in a series of bad habits. With
                            my coaching I’ve created a new level of inspiration and motivation for them,
                            which I can do for you too.
