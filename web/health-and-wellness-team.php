                          <span style="font-size:16px;">(Former President and COO of Sears Roebuck and Co.)</span>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Jim Clifford has acted as an advisor to the company since mid-2008. Jim retired in 2002 from Sears Roebuck and Company where he held the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of the mall based stores ($25 billion in revenue). Prior to this position, Jim was President and Chief Operating Officer and member of the Board of Directors of Sears Canada, a public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Jim has held senior management positions with a variety of retailing and manufacturing companies. He has served as Chief Financial Officer of four public companies and has served on the Board of Directors of three companies. Since retiring, he has consulted with several companies and acted as Senior Advisor to Bearingpoint Consulting formally KPMG Consulting.</p>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Beginning nearly a year ago, Jim engaged Mel O’Keefe as a personal trainer and has seen excellent gains in his strength, fitness and overall health and wellness.</p>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Jim states, "Mel’s training methods are effective - which is great for those fortunate individuals who can afford to hire him one-on-one. I became involved with Virtual Fitness Coach because I believe that the method and approach Mel developed is readily transferable to a virtual and extremely affordable medium."</p>

                          <span style="font-size:16px;"></span>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Mel O’Keefe channeled his early executive business successes as vice president of several mid-size companies to pursue his passion in health and fitness, which began 30 years ago. Mel had been an aspiring body builder and personal trainer in London, England, and later obtained his Certified Personal Trainer (CPT) accreditation from the National Academy of Sports Management (NASM).</p>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">In 2002, Mel took a year-long sabbatical to run a road race a week for 52 weeks, while travelling around America to raise awareness and funds to fight cancer. During this period, he became a marathon coach for Team in Training (TNT), a fundraising division of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, where he was awarded the Team in Training Man of the Year Award for his motivational speaking and many visitations of support with children suffering from cancer. His passion for running and fundraising ultimately ulminated in a “marathon-a-day for 18 days” event for cancer research by running from San Diego to Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Today, Mel continues to train clients one-on-one driven by the goal of helping people change their lives through health, fitness and improved quality of life.</p>

                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Dale Sutcliffe gained extensive executive and marketing experience in building www.VetFriends.com, the most popular web site in the U.S. for reuniting military veterans and networking veteran-owned businesses.</p>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Launched in 2000, VetFriends.com has received over 10,000,000 visitors with nearly 1,000,000 enrolled members.

                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Lance’s history of fitness and athletics is rivaled by very few physicians, having completed over 100 triathlons, including Ironman and 3 half Ironman distances. Lance is a practicing physician in Charleston, SC, and is a Lieutenant Commander with the U.S. Naval Reserve Medical Corps.</p>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he earned a BS in Biology, a Master’s Degree in Nutrition and Public Health, and completed Medical School. Lance is board certified in Family Medicine and also in Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine.</p>
                           <p style="margin-top:10px">While working at the Duke University Center for Living, he designed and implemented lifestyle intervention programs for cardiac patients. He has supervised the wellness and screening programs for thousands of firefighters, police, paramedics, divers and athletes, as well as his regular patients.

                           <p style="margin-top:10px">Years later, Mike began combining artificial intelligence and animation in an effort to create “Virtual Language                         Tutors” that could be accessed by language learners worldwide at a fraction of the cost of “live” oneon-                         one tutors. For that market, last year he then launched www.virtuallanguagetutor.com. Mike is an avid                         athlete and an aspiring Olympian (he attempted to make the Olympic team in 2004 as a freestyle wrestler).                         He is also a lifelong language learner and is proficient in Spanish, Italian, German and Japanese.</p>
